        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior software developer with team lead experience. I love a
          friendly team, where decisions are made rationally, when a senior is
          not shy about asking a less experienced developer for advice. Where
          there is an understanding that everyone has their own strengths. My
          strong point (IMHO) is most likely in the building of teams (with
          experience working as a team lead). I have introduced an overseas
          project as PO / Teach Lead. I like to teach others, without pressure.
          But also I like coding as only developer. Now my goal is to strengthen
          my skills as a developer as much as possible. For the last two years I
          have worked as an assistant client architect or as a client architect.
          At the moment I am doing all the client architecture in gambling. I
          mostly work with graphics and browser canvas. But always open to
          something new. Have experience with backend
