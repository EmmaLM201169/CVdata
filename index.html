        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am an experienced software developer with a background in team leadership. 
          I excel in a collaborative work environment where decisions are made thoughtfully, and where experienced team members readily assist their colleagues. 
          I strongly believe in the potential for motivated individuals to grow and become specialists in their field.

          My primary expertise lies in team management, as well as in developing applications from the ground up using well-established libraries and frameworks. 
          I have successfully overseen international projects.
        
          I am dedicated to mentoring and fostering talent, helping individuals grow without applying undue pressure. 
          Additionally, I enjoy hands-on coding and remain actively involved as a developer.
          
          Currently, my goal is to further enhance my skills as an architectural developer and to improve my ability to manage remote teams. 
          Over the past four years, I have held positions as an Assistant Client Architect and Client Architect, specializing in full-stack development within the gambling industry. 
          My work predominantly involves graphics and browser canvas, while I also welcome opportunities to explore new challenges, including live server-side coding and database management
