        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am an experienced software developer with a background in team
          leading. I excel in a collaborative work environment where decisions
          are made thoughtfully, and where experienced team members readily
          assist their colleagues. I strongly believe in the potential for
          motivated individuals to grow and become specialists in their field.
        </p>
        <p>
          My primary expertise lies in team management, as well as in developing
          applications from the ground up using well-established libraries and
          frameworks. I have successfully overseen international projects in
          roles such as Product Owner and Technical Lead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am dedicated to mentoring and fostering talent, helping individuals
          grow without applying undue pressure. Additionally, I enjoy hands-on
          coding and remain actively involved as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, my goal is to further enhance my skills as an architectural
          developer and to improve my ability to manage remote teams. Over the
          past four years, I have held positions as an Assistant Client
          Architect and Client Architect, specializing in full-stack development
          within the gambling industry. My work predominantly involves graphics
          and browser canvas, while I also welcome opportunities to explore new
          challenges, including live server-side coding and database management.
